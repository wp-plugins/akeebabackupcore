	<h3>Security advice</h3>
	<p>
		Your version of PHP, <?php echo PHP_VERSION ?>, <a href="http://php.net/eol.php">has reached the end
		of its life</a>. You are strongly urged to upgrade to a current version, as using older versions may expose you
		to security vulnerabilities and bugs that have been fixed in more recent versions of PHP.
